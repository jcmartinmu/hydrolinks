# hydrolinks R Package
Hydrologic Network Linking Data and Tools for R

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lawinslow/hydrolinks.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lawinslow/hydrolinks) | [![CRAN_Status_Badge](http://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/hydrolinks)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=hydrolinks)
 
## Package Description

This package provides tools for linking latitude and longitude (geopoint) data with 
hydrologic networks, such as the [U.S. Geologic Survey's National Hydrologic Dataset (NHD)](http://nhd.usgs.gov)
or they global [hydroLakes](http://www.hydrosheds.org/page/hydrolakes) dataset. The function automates 
the access and download of these large, cumbersome datasets and provides a number of techniques for 
geographic data to the hydro networks. 


hydrolinks will soon be submitted and available on CRAN. Until then, 
it is available for install direction from github. 

```
library(devtools)
install_github('lawinslow/hydrolinks')
